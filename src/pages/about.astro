      <p class="text-lg text-muted dark:text-slate-400 mb-6">
        Appaxon was born from a shared vision among seasoned cybersecurity professionals and leading AI researchers who saw a critical gap in how product security was traditionally approached. Reactive measures were no longer sufficient in the face of increasingly sophisticated and automated attacks. 
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-muted dark:text-slate-400">
        We envisioned a future where security could be proactive, intelligent, and deeply integrated into the fabric of product development. Leveraging breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and machine learning, we set out to build a platform that could anticipate threats, automate defenses, and provide developers with the tools and insights needed to create truly secure products. Our journey is one of continuous innovation, driven by a commitment to making the digital world safer for everyone.
